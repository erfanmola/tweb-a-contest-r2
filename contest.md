# TASK I (Editor)

# TASK II (Folders UI) (R2)
## R1

# TASK III (Animated Backgrouunds) (R2)
## R1
- Default Dark/Light
- Animated Backgrounds Dark / Light
- Animated Dark Backgrounds in Light Mode

## R2

# TASK IIII (ESG Panel UI) (R2)

TBH, I did not expect R2 begin immediately after R1 with two weeks of deadline, so I did not had time to do good stuff.
So that's all for today.

BTW, I have been working on a TMA Development Environment Simulator for all TG Clients called TMA Studio (https://github.com/erfanmola/TMA-Studio) and failed to get grants for it's further phase developments from TON Society, thought Telegram might be interested as I am.
